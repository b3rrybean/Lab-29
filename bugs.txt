Bug #1: The file reading skipped the last line because of missing newline
Fix: Added if (line.empty()) continue; to avoid reading empty trailing lines.

Bug #2: Forgot to seed the random number generator
Fix: Added srand(time(0)); inside the function

Bug #3: File-parsing logic is outside the while loop
Fix: Moving the stringstream logic inside the loop

Bug #4: "new" fans were added to season list (index 0) instead of new list (index 2)
Fix: Changed gameFans[opponent][0] to gameFans[opponent][2]
