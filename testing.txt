Unit Testing Plan for simulateAttendanceChanges()

The simulateAttendanceChanges() function modifies the map of fan data over a series of time periods.
To unit test this function I would create a small controlled dataset in memory to verify that the
function correctly adds, removes, and converts fans between lists.

The test will check:
- That adding fans increases the list size
- That removing fans decreases the list size
- That converting a fan from new to casual moves them between the correct lists
