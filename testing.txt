Unit Testing Plan for simulateAttendanceChanges()

The simulateAttendanceChanges() function modifies the map of fan data over a series of time periods.
To unit test this function I would create a small controlled dataset in memory to verify that the
function correctly adds, removes, and converts fans between lists.

The test will check:
- That adding fans increases the list size
- That removing fans decreases the list size
- That converting a fan from new to casual moves them between the correct lists

// Add dummy fans for testing
gameFans["Ducks"][0].push_back("Fan001");
gameFans["Ducks"][1].push_back("Fan002");
gameFans["Ducks"][2].push_back("Fan003");

cout << "Before: "
     << gameFans["Ducks"][0].size() << " season, "
     << gameFans["Ducks"][1].size() << " casual, "
     << gameFans["Ducks"][2].size() << " new fans.\n";

simulateAttendanceChanges(gameFans, 1);

cout << "After: "
     << gameFans["Ducks"][0].size() << " season, "
     << gameFans["Ducks"][1].size() << " casual, "
     << gameFans["Ducks"][2].size() << " new fans.\n";
