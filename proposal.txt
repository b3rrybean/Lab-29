Project Overview:
My project creates a simulation for attendance patterns at San Jose Sharks hockey games.
This software will illustrate the potential impact that different factors like recent promotions, 
bad weather, and winning streaks will have.

Implementation:
I plan to use an std::map where each key represents an opponent team and the value is a 3-element
std::array of std::lists where list 1 is season ticket holders, list 2 is casual fans, and list 3 is first-time fans.

These lists will store ticket IDs of the fans.

The map data will populate using an external file containing 100 lines of data, where each line represents a fan's category
and which game they are attending.

Simulated events:
The simulation will focus on three events: recent promotion for the game which would result in an increase, bad weather
which would result in a decrease, or new fans switching to casual fans which would track a shift in fan type. At any given
time period these may occur.

The simulation will run for 25 time periods, each representing a new game night.
